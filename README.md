# Quote bot

A bot built using Claudia Bot Builder.

This is a very simple bot that will respond with an inspirational quote from the [Forismatic API](http://forismatic.com/en/api/).

If you send a message with the string "quote" in, you will get a quote. Otherwise you will get a greeting.

This was created to show how to [build bots using Claudia Bot Builder and Twilio SMS](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/12/create-an-sms-bot-on-aws-lambda-with-claudia-js.html).
